# About

**Interrogation** is a narrative game that emulates the atmosphere of dark investigation procedurals to put the player in the detective’s seat and challenge their preconceptions with noire intensity. The game is intended to emulate the tropes related to interrogation scenes in pop-culture while also offering some deconstruction. It plays as a questions-based puzzle against a (5 minute) clock in which the player must manage the emotions of suspects and interpret information into discovering details about future terrorist attacks.

# Features

The current prototype's features:

* Noire art and custom soundtrack in increasingly heavier rhythm for deep immersion and tension

* Variable-based puzzle system (HP, Fear, Empathy, Cruelty) that get built up in order to unlock new answers to questions and from that new questions

* Question list, Briefing Files, "Enhanced" Interrogation

* Successive Episodes in increasing complexity and difficulty

In the fully developed game we also want to explore:

* Hard "campaign" choices, on questions like: informants, interacting with the press, racial profiling, etc. All of the choices to have meaningful impact on the campaign.

* Being interrogated: How do you make sure you don't reveal too much, how do you gain the interrogator's trust, how do you avoid being tortured?

* Consequences of earlier interrogations: Things found out early in the game (or not found out) become important much later.

* Hard moral choices: Do you resonate to any extent with the bad guys? Do you see their point at all? Is having a war with them the solution? Do you want to work with the enemy in any way?
