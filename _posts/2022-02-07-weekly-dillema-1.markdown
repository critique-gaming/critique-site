Leading an indie game-dev studio is kind of cool but it's mostly grindy, filled with uncomfortable moments and plagued by decision fatigue. This last part is the subject of our new **DDW** miniseries: Dexter's Dilemma of the Week 

This week's dilemma: Should we have full voice acting in Good Morning AI?

PROS:
- people like voice acting in games. Based on the type of comments we got at conferences about Interrogation, for many voice acting is a must in their games
- you do get to express a lot more about characters' personality 
- directing recording sessions is fun, even though exhausting 

CONS:
- it's expensive, both in terms of money, but mostly in terms of time. And we ain't got any to spare of either. 
- casting is really hard: I got cringed by a ton of video games with miscast actors, straight-up bad voice acting or dubious-at-best audio quality. There's a risk we'll spend time and money to get a worse game.

Next week's **DDW** I'll let you know what I chose, together with presenting my next dilemma. Till then, if you want to change my mind in any way, comment away.
