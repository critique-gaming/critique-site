# The Gods are Fickle

**The Gods are Fickle** is a single-player-first, rogue-lite, turn-based squad-tactics game, with CCG elements, in which teams of heroes' souls compete for answers and favor from vain, egocentric Gods. Your army of souls has been summoned by vain gods - fight for their glory or spit in their face! Embark in roguelite campaigns, discover Souls & Artifacts, deal with the godly politicking they produce. Anticipate moves & checkmate your foes in this no-RNG, procedural turn-based tactical!

With The Gods Are Fickle, we set out to marry the mechanical tightness and lack of RNG of the most successful tactics game of all time - chess - with the innovations and fun brought by great modern turn-based games such as Banner Saga, Battle Brothers, Duelyst, Trials of Fire, Hearthstone or Magic: The Gathering and all the other greats.
