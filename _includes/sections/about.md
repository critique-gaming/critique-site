# About

The Critique Gaming team is an eclectic squad consisting of five people with very different social and educational backgrounds, from law and economy to art and programming, with very diverse skillsets. We’ve gathered with the mission of making pointful games that explore important contemporary questions. After testing a few directions, we’re looking to moving on from amateur into professional independent game development with our Interrogation prototype.

Our mugshots go here.
