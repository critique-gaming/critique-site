# Interrogation

Interrogation is a narrative game that emulates the atmosphere of dark investigation procedurals to put the player in the detectiveâ€™s seat and challenge their preconceptions with noire intensity. The game is intended to emulate the tropes related to interrogation scenes in pop-culture while also offering some deconstruction. It plays as a questions-based puzzle against a (5 minute) clock in which the player must manage the emotions of suspects and interpret information into discovering details about future terrorist attacks.
